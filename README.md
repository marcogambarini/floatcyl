# floatcyl
Implementation of wave interaction theory for floating cylinders.

The code is based on the works
- O. Yilmaz, *Hydrodynamic interactions of waves with group of truncated vertical cylinders*, Journal of waterway, port, coastal, and ocean engineering, 1998
- B. F. M. Child, *On the configuration of arrays of floating wave energy converters*, PhD Thesis, University of Edinburgh, 2011
